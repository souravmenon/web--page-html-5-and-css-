<b><>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</b>
<ul><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</ul>
<ul><b>1933</b>Leaves his family's farm to attend the University</br> of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program</br> known as the "National Youth Administration"</ul>
<ul><b>1935</b> Has to stop school and save up more money.</br> Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping </br>starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he</br> said. "All of this left scars on me."</ul>
<ul><b>1937</b>Finishes university and takes a job in the US</br> Forestry Service</ul>
<ul><b>1938</b> Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets </br>laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles</br> Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman,</br> who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</ul>
<ul><b>1941</b>Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl </br>Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked</br> his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control </br>malaria, disinfectants, and other applied</br> science.</ul>
<ul><b>1942</b>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</ul>
<ul><b>1944</b> Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,</br> leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to</br> head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,</br> his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease</br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</ul>
<ul><b>1945</b>Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</ul>
<ul><b>1953</b> crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat</br> with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain</br> that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide</br> 95% of Mexico's wheat.</ul>
<ul><b>1962</b> Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains</br> of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help </br>mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding</br> population</ul>
<ul><b>1970</b>receives the Nobel Peace Prize</ul>
<ul><b>1983</b> helps seven African countries dramatically </br>increase their maize and sorghum yields</ul>
<ul><b>2005</b> becomes a distinguished professor at Texas</br> A&M University</ul>

<ul><b>2009</b>states "we will have to double the world food </br>supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops</br> are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run</br> out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not</br> inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically</br> modifying plants and animals for a long</br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the</br> best breeds."</ul>
</br>

<p><ul>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-</br>reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect,</br> persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and</br> progress."

-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</ul></p>
